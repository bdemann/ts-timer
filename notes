Up and running with type script
what is curl and why shoudl I use it?

Alright I just got off of the phone with jordan last and he got me up and running here is what we did

The first step was to get nvm installed on the machine

Then we used nvm to install the version of node that we wanted

Then we used npm to install the packages that we wanted into our project

Then we installed zwiterion and I don't know exactly what it does but its good for getting up and running

Lets dive into each step a little bit more

node.js (node) is the server I think for our web project. It would be worth looking more into node.js more but for right now it is what lets us get up and running. 
Now we could just install node in ubuntu but that's not the best option. It doesn't give us a lot of flexibility for versions of node.js. (I don't know why we need that flexiblity yet but whatever) Instead we install node version manager (nvm) and it will help us get the versions of node.js we need.
npm is part of node?

Exact steps to recreate
went to nvm git up page and looked for instructions to install
there were two options one with wget and one with curl (hence the curl question above)
I took the wget one
`wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash`
I ran that
I ran nvm to make sure it was installed (or maybe I ran it and noticed that the terminal need to be reopened to install correctly. my guess is that since the philosophy is to not install it as part of the system that it must get run as part of .bashrc or something and so we would need to reopen the terminal for it to get sorced properly)
I closed the terminal
I ran nvm again to make sure it installed right
It was so I ran
`nvm install 12`
which installed node version 12
I ran `node` to make sure that it brought up the node terminal
I ran `node -v` to make sure I had version 12
Was this also supposed to install version 12 of nvm? No right it must have jsut been node version 12 surley?
`which npm`
to make sure npm was installed
closed the terminal again to make sure that it worked every time I opened the terminal
checked the version of node
took a peek inside the ~/.nvm dir (thats where all of the versions of node get installed)
navigated to my project dir
made an index.html
`npm init -y`
opened up the package.json
Made some quick edits to the file
    set version to 0 instead of 1 because its not version 1 yet
    I got rid of the test script and added a start script which is
        "start": "zwitterion"
    I changed the licence to MIT
    I added me as the author "Name <email address>" "Benjamin DeMann <benjamin.demann@gmail.com>"
`npm install zwitterion`
edited the package.json file again
    In the version number of zwiterrion I got rid of the carrot. I don't know why it was there or why we got rid of it...
    it was something about being flexible on the minor versions?
edited the index.html file with the following template html
    <!doctype html>
    <html><all of the other html I added></html>
`npm start`
in a browser went to localhost:5000 and verified that I saw my html
added an example ts file
imported it into the html file
reloaded the web page
edited the ts file while zwitteron was still running
noticed that zwitteron updated the files on the fly
Its got to be zwiterion thats transpiling the ts right? It looks like the thing that is acting like the server here
And thats it!!

Now I can just edit type script to my hearts content

Questions
1) What is zwiterion? Assuming that jordan's package is not universally used what to other people use?
1) What is node
1) What is the best way to find packages that I want to use?
1) What is a good IDE for Typescript? Is there one? I feel like one of the nice things about a good strongly typed language is that my ide can catch a lot of error for me... 
1) Where does git go in all of this?
